# GTCH
this project was originally created in spring of 2023 for my fundamentals of programming course 
it is a simple 2d board game where the goal is to reach the middle of the 9x9 map by rolling a dice. There are also some chance cards and shortcuts.
i made the players mice and the goal in the middle a piece of cheese.
Written in c using structs switch cases and a main game loop the logic is simple enough for a first project.
the graphic was done using allegro and everything is hand-drawn.
some of my drawings for the game:
